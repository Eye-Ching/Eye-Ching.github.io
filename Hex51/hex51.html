    <p class="judge">Good fortune.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="judge">Nine in the <b>second place</b> means:</p>
    <p class="judge">Shock comes bringing danger.</p>
    <p class="judge">A hundred thousand times</p>
    <p class="judge">You lose your treasures</p>
    <p class="judge">And must climb the nine hills.</p>
    <p class="judge">Do not go in pursuit of them.</p>
    <p class="judge">After seven days you will get them back again.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="judge">Six in the <b>third place</b> means:</p>
    <p class="judge">Shock comes and makes one distraught.</p>

  <p class="title">51/  <meta charset="utf-8">震 / ䷲</meta> / The KĂn Hexagram</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">Kăn gives the intimation of ease and development. When (the time of) movement (which it indicates) comes, (the subject of the hexagram) will be found looking out with apprehension, and yet</p>
  <p class="judge">smiling and talking cheerfully. When the movement (like a crash of thunder) terrifies all within a hundred lî, he will be (like the sincere worshipper) who is not (startled into) letting go his ladle and (cup of) sacrificial spirits.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject, when the movement approaches, looking out and around with apprehension,</p>
  <p class="judge">and afterwards smiling and talking cheerfully. There will be good fortune.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge"> shows its subject, when the movement approaches, in a position of peril. He judges it better to let go the articles (in his possession), and to</p>
  <p class="judge">ascend a very lofty height. There is no occasion for him to pursue after (the things he has let go); in seven days he will find them.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject distraught amid the startling movements going on.</p>
  <p class="judge">If those movements excite him to (right) action, there will be no mistake.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject, amid the startling movements, supinely sinking (deeper) in the mud.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject going and coming amidst the startling movements (of the time), and always in peril;</p>
  <p class="judge">but perhaps he will not incur loss, and find business (which he can accomplish).</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>sixth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject, amidst the startling movements (of the time), in breathless dismay and looking round him with trembling apprehension.</p>
  <p class="judge">If he take action, there will be evil. If, while the startling movements have not</p>
  <p class="judge">reached his own person and his neighbourhood, (he were to take precautions), there would be no</p>
  <p class="judge">error, though his relatives might (still) speak against him.</p>
