  <p class="title">Explanation of the entire figure by king Wăn</p>
  <p class="judge">Hsiâo Kwo indicates that (in the circumstances which it implies) there will be progress and attainment.</p>
  <p class="judge">But it will be advantageous to be firm and correct. (What the name denotes) may be done in small affairs, but not in great affairs.</p>
  <p class="judge">(It is like) the notes that come down from a bird on the wing;--to descend is better than to ascend. There will (in this way) be great good fortune.</p>

  <p class="title">Explanation of the separate lines by the duke of Kâu</p>
  <p class="judge">The <b>first SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">suggests (the idea of) a bird flying, (and ascending) till the issue is evil.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>second SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject passing by his grandfather, and meeting with his</p>
  <p class="judge">grandmother; not attempting anything against his ruler, but meeting him as his minister. There will be no error.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>third NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject taking no extraordinary precautions against danger;</p>
  <p class="judge">and some in consequence finding opportunity to assail and injure him. There will be evil.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fourth NINE</b>, undivided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject falling into no error, but meeting (the exigency of his situation), without exceeding (in his natural. course). </p>
  <p class="judge">If he go forward, there will be peril, and he must be cautious. There is no occasion to be using firmness perpetually.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>fifth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">(suggests the idea) of dense clouds, but no rain, coming from our borders in the west.</p>
  <p class="judge">It also (shows) the prince shooting his arrow, and taking the bird in a cave.</p>

  <br>

  <p class="judge">The <b>sixth SIX</b>, divided,</p>
  <p class="judge">shows its subject not meeting (the exigency of his situation), and exceeding (his proper course).</p>
